# 📅 Daily Log — Python DSA Journey

Tracking my daily learning, concepts covered, and reflections on progress.

---

## 📌 Date: **2025-07-04**

### 🧠 Topics Covered:
- ✅ **Git & GitHub Workflow**
  - Cloning a repo
  - `git add`, `commit`, `push`
  - Fixing broken Markdown links
  - Understanding file paths, `%20`, and case sensitivity
  - Structured `README.md` with clickable `.md` links
- ✅ **Markdown Syntax**
  - Headings, tables, links, relative paths
  - Creating clean documentation inside GitHub
- ✅ **Python Fundamentals**
  - 🔤 Variables → *Labeled boxes*
  - 🔁 Loops → *Habits / Repetition*
  - ❓ Conditionals → *Decisions*
  - 🧠 Functions → *Reusable machines (Blender metaphor)*
  - 🪞 Recursion → *Function calling itself (Mirror metaphor)*
- ✅ **Data Structures**
  - 🧺 Arrays → *Tray of eggs*
  - 🍽️ Stacks → *Plate pile (Last In, First Out)*
  - 🧍 Queues → *Waiting line (First In, First Out)*
  - 🗺️ Linked Lists → *Treasure map (Node to node)*

### 📝 Reflections:

> 💥 *Today was a breakthrough.*  
> I learned the full Git workflow — from cloning a repo to pushing live Markdown documentation. Debugging broken file links, `%20` issues, and navigating deep folder structures tested my patience, but I didn’t give up.  
>  
> For the first time, Python and DSA concepts actually **clicked** because of visual metaphors: functions are blenders, recursion is a mirror, stacks are plate piles.  
>  
> This is the first day it all started to feel **real** — like I’m becoming a true developer.

# 🧠 Daily Log – Python DSA Journey
### 📅 Date: 11 July 2025 (Friday)

---

## ✅ Today’s Progress:
- [x] Completed **Functions Module**
  - Wrote and understood: `factorial`, `fibonacci`, `is_prime`, `is_palindrome`, lambda, and variable arguments
  - Committed clean code to GitHub
- [x] Set up **Recursion Module**
  - Added notes on recursion theory and when to use it
  - Implemented 7 classic recursive problems
- [x] Fixed Git issues (merge conflicts, non-fast-forward errors)
  - Learned to handle `git pull`, merge messages, and push cleanly

---

## 🧪 Concepts Learned:
- Base case vs Recursive case
- Recursive thinking vs Iterative loops
- Stack behavior in recursion
- Git workflows: pull → merge → push

---

## 💡 Reflections:
> “Recursion felt scary at first, but breaking it into base and recursive steps made it click. I feel more confident now — this journey is actually working.”

---

## 📍 Next Up:
- Solve 2–3 recursion problems from Leetcode
- Write `recursion.md` notes on visual stack flow
- Explore backtracking logic with recursion

---
## 📅 Daily Log – 13th July 2025

### 🧵 Core Python Concepts Learned:
- ✅ Completed full theory + code for **Strings in Python**
  - String creation, indexing, slicing
  - Important string methods (`upper()`, `find()`, `replace()`, etc.)
  - Immutability, formatting with f-strings
  - Palindrome checker and vowel counter functions
  - Looping through strings
- 📝 Added:
  - `notes/strings.md` – clean markdown notes
  - `strings.py` – code examples with commentary

---

### 🔢 Major Project Milestone:
- ✅ Added a fully working **Sudoku Solver** using **recursion and backtracking**
  - Learnt and implemented algorithm from scratch
  - Applied problem-solving logic beyond basic DSA
  - Currently stored in `project.py` (to be modularized into `projects/sudoku_solver.py`)
  
---

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced:
- Recursion (again, via Sudoku)
- Backtracking technique
- Clean code structuring for clarity and reusability
- Git workflow (committing notes + projects properly)

---

### 🧭 Reflections:
- Learned not just how strings *work*, but how to apply them meaningfully (e.g., palindrome checks).
- Practicing string manipulation improved confidence in using Python for real problem solving.
- Sudoku project was a strong confidence boost: applying recursion to a large problem felt powerful.
- Seeing things click today. Momentum is real — and so is growth.

---

### 🔜 Next Steps:
- ✅ Organize `project.py` → `projects/sudoku_solver.py`
- ⏭️ Move on to **Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**
- ⏭️ Start markdown + code for **File Handling** and **Exception Handling**
- ⏭️ Visualize solving steps for Sudoku using GUI (Tkinter?)
