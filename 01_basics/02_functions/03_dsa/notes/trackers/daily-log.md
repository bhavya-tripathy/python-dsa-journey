## 📌 Date: **2025-07-04**

### 🧠 Topics Covered:
- ✅ **Git & GitHub Workflow**
  - Cloning a repo
  - `git add`, `commit`, `push`
  - Fixing broken Markdown links
  - Understanding file paths, `%20`, and case sensitivity
  - Structured `README.md` with clickable `.md` links
- ✅ **Markdown Syntax**
  - Headings, tables, links, relative paths
  - Creating clean documentation inside GitHub
- ✅ **Python Fundamentals**
  - 🔤 Variables → *Labeled boxes*
  - 🔁 Loops → *Habits / Repetition*
  - ❓ Conditionals → *Decisions*
  - 🧠 Functions → *Reusable machines (Blender metaphor)*
  - 🪞 Recursion → *Function calling itself (Mirror metaphor)*
- ✅ **Data Structures**
  - 🧺 Arrays → *Tray of eggs*
  - 🍽️ Stacks → *Plate pile (Last In, First Out)*
  - 🧍 Queues → *Waiting line (First In, First Out)*
  - 🗺️ Linked Lists → *Treasure map (Node to node)*

### 📝 Reflections:

> 💥 *Today was a breakthrough.*  
> I learned the full Git workflow — from cloning a repo to pushing live Markdown documentation. Debugging broken file links, `%20` issues, and navigating deep folder structures tested my patience, but I didn’t give up.  
>  
> For the first time, Python and DSA concepts actually **clicked** because of visual metaphors: functions are blenders, recursion is a mirror, stacks are plate piles.  
>  
> This is the first day it all started to feel **real** — like I’m becoming a true developer.
